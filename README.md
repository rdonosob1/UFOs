# UFOs
Using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to develop a website that can illustrate UFO sightings around the world using different search criteria.

## Project Overview
> Finally, Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, however, she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, the project will consist in adding a table filters for the city, state, country, and shape. 

## Results
The image below will show you a representation (example) of the how webpage would look like and the different filters added to use for the search criteria.

In order to use this site, the user will need to type down on any of the blank spaces (fields) either the name of the state, city, country, the shape or the date of the event. So, the page will illustrate the correspondant information as follows:

### Search by Date

### Search by city

### Search by state

### Search by country

### Search by shape

## Summary
### Drawback: The drawback of this site is that it is showing limited information only in a limited region (North America). If the user wants to see UFO sightings in other parts of the world, this site will not show that.

### Recommendations:
I'd be important to include other options such as:
* Searching by range of dates and add a drop-down menu to select different choices among the results.
* Creating a "Clear" button to start over again.
